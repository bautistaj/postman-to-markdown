## How to Contribute

Here are guides for submitting issues and pull requests.

### Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug that hasn't already been filed, please file a bug report.

to submit a new issue.
-   Include a descriptive title that is straight to the point.
-   Write a detailed description on what the issue is all about.
-   Wait for someone to get to the issue and add labels.

### Code Contributions

Contributing code is one of the more difficult ways to contribute to the Crypto
Service.

#### Feature Requests

Filing feature requests is one of the most popular ways to contribute to the
Crypto Service Suite.

Is there some feature request that you'd like to code up yourself? Is there a
feature you asked for yourself that you'd like to code?

Here's how to contribute code for a new feature to the Crypto Service Suite.
Pull Requests allow you to share your own code with us, and we can merge it into
the main repo.

#### Adding Code

-   Fork the repo.
-   Clone the Crypto Service Suite repo by running: 
`git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator.git`
-   Install Node.js if you haven't already, and run `npm install`.
This installs the required dependencies for building the Crypto Service Suite.
-   Edit files in the `src/` folder. Don't edit any files in the `dist/` folder,
this is only for distribution builds, which are automated.
-   Run `npm run build` to trigger builds, and the new distribution files will
be in the `dist/` folder ready to go.
